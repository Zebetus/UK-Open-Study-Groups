# UK-Open-Study-Groups

Looking at starting a Mozilla Open Study Group in the UK and seeing how it can be applied to UK university structures

# What are Study Groups?
There is a mozilla project (run through [mozilla science labs](https://mozillascience.org/)) called Science Study Groups, the introduction of which can be found at this link https://www.mozillascience.org/introducing-mozilla-science-study-groups.

This project has never been implemented in the UK and hence we are currently looking at creating a format which could be used in the UK and in conjunction with UK universities in a way that can be picked up by a student or lecturer to set up their own study group.
